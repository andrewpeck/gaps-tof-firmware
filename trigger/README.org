#+TITLE: GAPS Master Trigger

* LT to MT Dataformat
The LT to MT link consists of 2 LVDS pairs per MT.

This can be optionally expanded to 3 pairs with an unstuffed isolator, in case of bandwidth requirements.

Each MT pair transmits at 200 Mbps, on an *asynchronous* clock.

The data format on each pair consists of a start bit, followed by the data payload.

The entire data packet consists of 48 bits of payload (16 channels \times low, medium, and high threshold).

Since it is divided into 2 links, this means 24 bits / link + 2 start bits per trigger.

It shall be transmitted MSB first? (or LSB first? doesn't matter at all, just agree on both ends).

The scheme should be something like:

#+begin_src
LINK0: START + LOW[15:0] + MED[7:0]
LINK1: START + MED[15:7] + HIGH[15:0]
#+end_src
