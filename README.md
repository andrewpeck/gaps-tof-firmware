# readout-firmware

Firmware repo for UCLA DRS4 readout board

These files are used to generate a project file for GAPS Readout V2.0 Board. 

Before generating a project, it is necessary for the cores to exist in directory /readout-firmware/ip_repo

Directory /readout-firmware/ip_repo is automatically generated by running the tcl scripts in each firmware directory.
/readout-firmware/<firmware>/tcl

run the scripts to generate the cores:

DMA Write IP Core:
vivado.bat -mode tcl
source build_ip_dma_write.tcl

DRS IP Core:
vivado.bat -mode tcl
source build_ip_drs.tcl

DWrite Trigger IP Core:
vivado.bat -mode tcl
source build_ip_dwrite_trig.tcl

Build GAPS Readout V2.0 Board Project:
vivado.bat -mode tcl
source build_project_GAPSReadoutV2_0.tcl
